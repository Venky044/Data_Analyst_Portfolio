# Data_Analyst_Portfolio
A showcase of my data analysis skills through three diverse datasets

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository showcases my skills through a variety of projects:

1. **Project 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation (P_1)**  
   Dive into a comprehensive data cleaning and transformation project that takes a messy FIFA 21 dataset and turns it into a structured, insightful resource.
   FIFA 21 is a popular video game that simulates soccer matches. Often, data collected from this game might be messy, containing inconsistencies, missing values, and various formatting issues.
   - Highlights:
     - In this project, I focused on cleaning and preparing messi FIFA 21 data for analysis using Python and Pandas.
     - Cleaned and standardized player data, discovered performance trends, and created Dashboard using **Power BI**.

3. **Project 2: Data Analysis (P_2)**  
   Delve into the rich data of the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2022, uncovering trends, preferences, and valuable insights within the vibrant developer community. This analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - Key Insights:
     - Impact of Remote Work: The survey reveals the evolving landscape of work preferences among developers,
       - Fully remote: 42.98%
       - Hybrid (some remote, some in-person): 42.44%
       - Full in-person: 14.58%
     - Learning to Code Trends: The most popular learning method is 'School (i.e., University, College, etc)', with 3669 responses.
     - Demographics:
       - Age Distribution: The majority of survey respondents fall within the 25-34 age group.
       - Gender Distribution: The survey reflects a gender distribution of responses as follows,
         - Male: 90% (64607 responses)
         - Female: 5% (3399 responses)
         - Others: Remaining percentage
       - Geographical Distribution: A significant portion of responses originate from the USA, with over 14.5k responses.
     - Professions in Demand: Analysis points to Full Stack Developer as the most popular profession in 2022, with a notable 30000+ responses.
     - Popular Programming Languages: In the year 2022, JavaScript emerges as the top-ranking language among developers, indicating its enduring popularity and utility.


4. **Project 3: Data Visualization (P_3)**  
   Engage with interactive visualizations created using the London bike sharing dataset. Gain a clear perspective on usage patterns and urban transportation trends.  
   - Highlights: Visualized bike usage by time, weather impact on rentals, and peak usage hours.

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI

**Data Sources**: Kaggle
