# Data_Analyst_Portfolio
A showcase of my data analysis skills through three diverse datasets

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository showcases my skills through a variety of projects:

1. **Project 1: Data Cleaning & Transformation (P_1)**  
   Dive into a comprehensive data cleaning and transformation project that takes a messy FIFA 21 dataset and turns it into a structured, insightful resource.
   FIFA 21 is a popular video game that simulates soccer matches. Often, data collected from this game might be messy, containing inconsistencies, missing values, and various formatting issues.
   - Highlights:
     - In this project, I focused on cleaning and preparing messi FIFA 21 data for analysis using Python and Pandas.
     - Cleaned and standardized player data, discovered performance trends, and created visualizations using **Power BI**.
